## About

The project which simulate a basketball game with possibility to create a `LiveActivity` and leave the app.

Here I learned about `LiveActivities` fundamentials, how they work and how to:

-   create `LiveActivity` from the app;
-   create `LiveActivity` UI for diffetent system layouts: for `Lock Screen`, for `Dynamic Island`;
-   how to pass and update data from the app to `LiveActivity` extension.
