## About

The medium and large sized widgets show a GitHub repository's statistics including forks, stars, issues, name, days since last activity, and top-4 contributors with their avatar and nickname.

Possible to add needed repository name inside the app, then choose it to display via widget settings.

Here I learned how to:

-   create `medium` and `large` sized widgets;
-   display different content based on widget size;
-   make multiple network calls, receive and display data using `async/await`;
