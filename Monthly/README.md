## About

Here is my first project, using `WidgetKit`. The small sized widget shows the current date and change its colors based on current month.

Here I learned about widget fundamentials:

-   what is `Entry`, `Timeline`, `Snapshot` etc.;
-   how to dynamically update widget's content;
-   how to adjust colors for StandBy mode and iPad Locksreen;
-   how to create different `Timeline` previews in `Xcode`;
-   how to use `configuration` for widget's content;
-   how to add `animations` to widget's content.
