## About

The medium sized widget works with a `CoreData` framework and show a calendar view with a separate number of the longest learning streak.

Here I learned how to:

-   work with `CoreData` and `SwiftData` frameworks to display data in widgets;
-   work woth `Date` object to calculate different date related variables to use in a widget;
-   migrate `CoreData` container if the app already exists;
-   use `AppGroups` to share data between the app and widget extension;
-   create `Touch Targets` to open specific app's screen based on tapped widget side;
-   create interactive elements, such as button, to perform a specific action (iOS17);
-   create `Lock Screen` widgets.
